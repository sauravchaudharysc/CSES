# CSES
This repository is a collection of my gists (***working*** :white_check_mark: code snippets passing all test cases on the 
[CSES PROBLEM SET](https://cses.fi/problemset/list/) solutions in the absolutely fantastic 
language, C++. 

***Edit:*** I've lately moved to Java hence trying to re-solve all the problems slowly and adding my Java solutions to this repo as well!

## Notes:
- Sometimes, multiple solutions/approaches have been provided with relevant comments in the solution file, these are being continuously updated as and when I find a more optimized solution. 
- I've used C++ stl features in each and every solution.
- *The code in this repo is completely original content and written by me.* If you like what you see, don't forget to show your liking by :star:ing this repo.

## How to contribute?
1. Fork the repository :fork_and_knife:
2. Do the desired changes (add/delete/modify) :pencil2:
4. Attach a screenshot from [CSES PROBLEM SET](https://cses.fi/problemset/list/) showing that your solution was ACCEPTED by the online judge. I've been getting a lot of pull requests which are not Accepted by the online judge.
3. Make a pull request :shipit:

## When should you contribute?
- If your solution's time complexity :alarm_clock: is better than the solution already present *or*,
- If your solution's space complexity :floppy_disk: is better than the solution already present *or*,
- If your solution is of the same time *and* space complexity but is more concise :page_with_curl:. 
In this case, comment out the original solution & make a pull request with your solution *or*,
- If your solution is of the same time *and* space complexity but is easier/more readable :page_facing_up: to understand *or*,
- If you use the same solution as present in the main branch and have gone the extra mile to add short comments :memo: 
explaining what's happening or what's the rationale at that particular code line, wherever necessary. :pray:
